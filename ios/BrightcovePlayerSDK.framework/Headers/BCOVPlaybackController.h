/**
 * Typedef for a view strategy given to a playback controller to construct its
 * `view` property.
 *
 * A view strategy is simply a block that takes two parameters, a UIView and a
 * BCOVPlaybackController, and returns a UIView. It is used to
 * compose UIView objects to create a view hierarchy that will ultimately be
 * accessible from a BCOVPlaybackController's `view` property. To construct
 * your own view strategy, simply implement a block conforming to this signature
 * and within the block, assemble the view hierarchy as you require. For
 * example, you might want to insert custom controls into the view strategy
 * you use when creating a playback controller:
 *
 *   BCOVPlaybackControllerViewStrategy vs = ^ UIView * (UIView *videoView, id<BCOVPlaybackController> playbackController) {
 *
 *     videoView.frame = myFrame;
 *
 *     MyControlsView *controls = [[MyControlsView alloc] initWithVideoView:videoView];
 *     [playbackController addSessionConsumer:controls];
 *
 *     return controls;
 *
 *   };
 *
 * This example view strategy, when given to a playback controller, will
 * instruct the controller to return the MyControlsView instead of whatever
 * view it would otherwise have returned from its `view` property (that view
 * is the `videoView` parameter to the block). Note how this code adds the
 * MyControlsView object as a session consumer to the session consumer container
 * that is also passed into the block. Not every object will need to be added
 * as a session consumer, but for controls or other views that care about the
 * current playback session, it probably makes sense to conform to the
 * BCOVPlaybackSessionConsumer protocol and pass it in, so as to be able to take
 * action when a new session is delivered.
 *
 * @param view The "original" view that is to be composed by the view this
 * block will return. This will typically be or contain a video playback view.
 * @param playbackController A playback controller for any session consumers that
 * are created within the block and need to be added, so as to receive
 * notification of new playback sessions.
 * @return The UIView which the playback controller should use as its `view`.
